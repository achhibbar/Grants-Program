## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

An organization’s social responsibility can take the form of a wide variety of commitments. These can range from having a diverse workplace to increasing green energy use. It’s easy for an organization to make claims regarding how they’re run, but these often exist only as marketing copy. Etch is a platform that allows organizations to make socially responsible commitments and have them written indelibly to the blockchain using smart contracts. This will make an organization's stated goals regarding social responsibility transparent and permanent. It will also provide a place for workers to see what an organization stands for.

### Overview

Etch is software for organizations to make enduring commitments regarding their social responsibility.

Having worked previously on Advokat; an NLP powered chatbot that helped workers understand their rights during the COVID-19 Pandemic, it was clear from user input that many organizations didn’t behave in ways that aligned with their mandates. In addition, we feel strongly that inequality and global warming are the two defining issues of our time. We’d love to be able to contribute in some way to help alleviate these issues. Commitments made in marketing copy are like words on a whiteboard: easily erased when they prove to be inconvenient. It’s our hope that Etch makes socially responsible commitments more akin to words carved into stone.

This project will use ink! and substrate to create smart contracts that store the commitments. Create React app and Polkadot js will be used to create a front end to create and maintain these contracts with a simple UI.

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details

We will engage in user-research to identify in detail the requirements and needs of business owners and heads of organizations related to CSR commitments.

The software will include pre-made templates for different types of organizations. Users will then be able to customize these commitments before storing them on the blockchain.

An additional section will contain a UI where a user can store information about the employees and their salaries. The software will automatically create a report including information about gender pay gaps and pay ratios based on this data.

The goal with the proof of concept will be to implement the functionality for mock entities/organizations and not real-world organizations.

Examples of information to be stored and calculated for each organization:

Stored commitments
- Recycling
- Carbon offset usage
- Maternity/Paternity leave
- Paid sick leave
- Charitable donations
- Employee profit sharing
- Green energy generation
- Vegetarian/Vegan meal options
- No blocking of unionization efforts

Employee 
- Grade
- Salary
- Gender
- Demographic data

Metrics
- Median worker salary
- Gender representation
- Gender pay disparity
- Diversity
- Executive pay ratio


We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Our primary audience are business owners and heads of organizations. Particularly those who wish to distinguish themselves from others and attract enthusiastic workers who align with their mission. Additionally, workers who want to understand the commitments an organization has made would also find this useful.

There’s currently a great desire by workers that their employers to engage in socially responsible behavior, be held accountable and provide workers with purpose. Etch moves these commitments from websites to the blockchain to provide more transparency.


Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status :open_book:

We had a conversation with Sebastian Müller about the concept of Etch. He mentioned additional details that he’d like to see in a grant proposal and to start with a level 1 grant.

Articles and studies that point to meaningful, purpose driven work and CSR statistics becoming increasingly important to employees and workers.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
